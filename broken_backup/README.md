# README #

Python scripts for building and testing modflow and modpath models to test particle tracking for homogenous and heterogeneous examples as well as well capture zone analysis. 

## Installation notes

These tests were compiled with python using the following packages and versions:
=======
- Python = 3.6.5
- pandas = 0.23.3
- geopandas = 0.4.0
- matplotlib = 2.2.2
- flopy = 3.2.9 
- numpy = 1.15.0

If you do not yet have these packages installed, we recommend using the [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html) package manager to install all the requirements 

Please note that Anaconda and Miniconda are python package distributors, this means that Anaconda will be downloaded to your machine and will contain a working version of python. 

(you can install [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) or install the (larger) Anaconda
distribution, found at https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

Once this is installed, the following command will install all required packages in your Python environment, you may run this command out of a terminal if you add conda to your system's path, or you can simply use the Anaconda prompt:
(this may take a bit)
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will create a new environment called "modpath_qa"

To activate your new environment:
```
source activate modpath_qa
```

# Test Cases #
There are 5 test cases presented in this directory, each is to compare the USGS's modpath version 6 with alternative particle tracking solutions.

## Test Case 1
Test case 1 utilizes flopy and modpath6 to reproduce figure 7 in Pollock 1988

![alt text](https://github.com/rosskush/pollock_88_modpath/blob/master/Test_Case_1/fig7.PNG)

Particles are placed radially around the well cell in the bottom left corner and are tracked for 7,500 days.

![alt text](https://github.com/rosskush/pollock_88_modpath/blob/master//Test_Case_1/output/figures/7500_days.png)

To run this example follow these steps in a terminal or Anaconda prompt after moving to this directory:

(if not active already, activate the modpath_qa conda environment):
```
source activate modpath_qa
cd Test_Case_1
./runme.bat
```
This will produce a directory called output that plot figures and pass/fail statistics will be placed.

## Test Case 2
Test case 2 utilizes flopy and modpath6 to reproduce figure 10 in Pollock 1988

Particles are placed radially around the well cell in the bottom left corner and are tracked for 7,500 days.

To run this example follow these steps in terminal or Anaconda prompt after moving to this directory:

(if not active already, activate the modpath_qa conda environment):
```
source activate modpath_qa
cd Test_Case_2
./runme.bat
```
This will produce a directory called output that plot figures and pass/fail statistics will be placed.


## Test Case 3
Test Case 3 compares an analytical well capture zone solution described by Grubb in 1993 to the results from a backward particle track in modpath6, this example assumes a homogeneous unconfined system with a single extraction well.

To run this example follow these steps in a terminal or Anaconda prompt after moving to this directory:

(if not active already, activate the modpath_qa conda environment):
```
source activate modpath_qa
cd Test_Case_3
./runme.bat
```
This will produce a directory called output that figures and pass/fail statistics will be placed.

## Test Case 4
Test Case 4 compares the 10 year well capture zone for a steady state aquifer with a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity from an example from GWPATH (Shafer, 1987)

A modflow model was created to replicate this example and track backward particles with modpath 6

![alt text](https://github.com/rosskush/pollock_88_modpath/blob/master//Test_Case_4/outputs/pathline.png)

To run this example follow these steps in a terminal or Anaconda prompt after moving to this directory:

(if not active already, activate the modpath_qa conda environment):
```
source activate modpath_qa
cd Test_Case_4
./runme.bat
```
This will produce a directory called outputs that figures, shapefiles and pass/fail statistics will be placed.
(shapefiles include a grid of the model, the head contour after 10 years, and a bounding polygon of the 10-year capture zone)

## Test Case 5
Test Case 5 uses the same example from GWPATH (Shafer, 1987)

Although the modflow model is the same as Test Case 4, the backward particle tracking method used is SSPA's mod-PATH3DU version 2 (SSPA, 2018) 

![alt text](https://github.com/rosskush/pollock_88_modpath/blob/master//Test_Case_5/output/mp3du_pathline.png)

To run this example follow these steps in a terminal or Anaconda prompt after moving to this directory:

(if not active already, activate the modpath_qa conda environment):
```
source activate modpath_qa
cd Test_Case_5
./runme.bat
```
This will produce a directory called output that figures, shapefiles and pass/fail statistics will be placed.
(shapefiles include a bounding polygon of the 10-year capture zone, pathlines, and endpoints after 10 years)
